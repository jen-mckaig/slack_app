# Team Ticket App
## Slack -> Notion 

This is a simple low cost Slack app to help field requests. A slash command in Slack brings up a pop up form about the request/ticket. The ticket is posted directly to Notion as a kanban card. When the cards are moved to the completion stage, a notification is posted in Slack to the user and to the team. Meta data is stored in an S3 bucket.

To use this app you will need:
1. Notion account (free for individuals or $8 a month for a team)
2. Slack account & developer access (free for individuals)
3. Glitch account with a boosted service ($8 a month)
4. AWS S3 bucket (~$3 a month)
